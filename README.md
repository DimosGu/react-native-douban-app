**本来准备在 2016 春节期间重构这个项目并且完成的，但是豆瓣停止了个人开发者的全部 API 权限，所以只能暂时作罢。**

# Install

To run this app (named Watched, temporarily) on your own device, you should follow the steps:

0. You should have a Mac with Xcode 7.0 or later (RN required) installed. 
1. Watched is built with [React Native][1], therefore, you need RN installed. Follow the official [Get Started][2] page.
2. Clone the repo and go to `Watched` folder. 
3. Run `npm install react-native` and then `npm install`, to keep `node_modules` folder ordered. 
4. Click 'Run' in Xcode. 

# Notes

The idea was born on Oct 22h, 2015. I had done some work in the next two months and then turned to my intern job. I’ve picked it up during the coming Chinese Spring Festival holiday and let’s see what will I achieve!
